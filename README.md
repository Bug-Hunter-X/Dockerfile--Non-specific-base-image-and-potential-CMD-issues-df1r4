This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: using a non-specific base image and potentially incorrect CMD instructions. The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is not recommended as it might change frequently between builds. The `CMD` might fail depending on the application's structure. The solution showcases best practices by specifying a versioned base image, using a multi-stage build, explicitly installing dependencies, and correctly setting the application's entrypoint.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone the repo.
2. Build the original Dockerfile: `docker build -t buggy-app .`
3. Run the container: `docker run -p 8000:8000 buggy-app`
4. Observe any unexpected behavior or errors.

## How to fix the bug

1. Review the provided DockerfileSolution.txt
2. Build the improved Dockerfile: `docker build -t fixed-app -f DockerfileSolution.txt .`
3. Run the improved container: `docker run -p 8000:8000 fixed-app`
4. Notice the improved functionality and reproducibility.
